	<h1>Top 20 Fifa Youngsters</h1>
	
	<p>This list won't feature youngsters everyone knows, so don't expect Pogba, Draxler, Sterling, El Shaaraway, etc. This list is purely opinionated. Let's begin.
	</p>
	
	<h2>20.Erik Durm</h2>
	
	<h3>Borussia Dortmund LB/RB Germany</h3>
	
	<img src="durm.png"/>
	
	<p>Durm is the first of many talents I have used. He has been a strong left back for me. He is quick able to cross and defend. He has potential to replace Lahm in the German national squad. Let's not forget he has a dangerous long shot.
	</p>
	
	<h2>19.James Ward-Prowse</h2>
	
	<h3>Southampton CAM/CM England</h3>
	
	<img src="jwp.png"/>
	
	<p>Ironically the only Saints player on this list! Ward-Prowse is the next graduiate of the Saints academy. He feels like a young Gerrard or Lampard. He has pace, great passing and a long shoot like those previously mentioned. He's a playmaker and is great doing it. He has scored many long shots for me and shows he'll get behind the defence if needed. All in all, James is one of my favourite midfielders in the game!!
	</p>
	
	<h2>18.Anwar El Ghazi</h2>
	
	<h3>Ajax RW/LW Netherlands</h3>
	
	<img src="elghazi.png"/>
	
	<p>El Ghazi is my main man in my Ajax career mode. He has scored crucial goals. He is fast, strong enough to keep the ball against defenders and can make magic happen. He isn't the best player you'll ever play with but he's always a player you'd want in the team.
	</p>
	
	<h2>17.Ruben Neves</h2>
	
	<h3>Porto CM/CDM Portugal</h3>
	
	<img src="neves.png"/>
	
	<p>Neves is a great player. He is an all round midfielder. In my Porto career he has broke into the 11 and wrecked house. He defends when needed and attacks when needed. He is a perfect engine after year or two in your career. He is highly recommended from me</p>
	
	<h2>16.Alberto Moreno</h2>
	
	<h3>Liverpool LB/LM/LW Spain</h3>
	
	<img src="amoreno.png"/>
	
	<p>Moreno always pops up in great left backs. At first testing him out was intresting. He played as a left mid for me. He is one of the fastest players I have ever played with! He is a good reliable player anywhere on the left with a good long shot on him.
	</p>
	
	<h2>15.Robin Knoche</h2>
	
	<h3>Wolfsburg CB Germany</h3>
	
	<img src="knoche.png"/>
	
	<p>Knoche for me was a bit iffy at first. I never heard of him until I started my Wolfsburg career mode. After numerous games, I can safely say he is one of the most organised defenders I have ever used. He is the leader in the back and starts play for me. If you need a young yet strong, leader in your squad, Knoche is highly recommended.
	</p>
	
	<h2>14.Jordon Ibe</h2>
	
	<h3>Liverpool LW/RW England</h3>
	
	<img src"ibe.png"/>
	
	<p>Ibe has the lowest potential of any on this list. You must be asking why he's so high on this list. The reason is he's such a smooth player. He is fast, agail, strong and a finisher. He deserves a greater potential. He is my favourite Liverpool youngster from their academy. He is a close to perfect winger.
	</p>
	
	<h2>13.Matthew Ryan</h2>
	
	<h3>Club Brugge GK Australia</h3>
	
	<img src="ryan.png"/>
	
	<p>Ryan has grown on me. At first, he was just an average keeper. It was a while before I finally liked his style. Since then I love him. He's a great keeper who is rarely concedes. I would put him in the top 20 keepers in fifa he's that good!
	
	<h2>12.Felipe Anderson</h2>
	
	<h3>Lazio LW/RW/CAM Brazil</h3>
	
	<img src="anderson.png"/>
	
	<p>If you don't think these guys are high enough for you, Anderson will change your opinion. He is a great player who has won big games for me. He is a very fast and reliable winger. He has a lot of flair and skill and is the best Brazilian winger in my opinion. I can see this young man become the next Kaka for Brazil!!
	</p>
	
	<h2>11.Youri Tielamans</h2>
	
	<h3>Anderlecht CM/CDM/CAM Belgium</h3>
	
	<img src="youri.png"/>
	
	<h2>10.Geoffrey Kondogbia</h2>
	
	<h3>AS Monaco CDM/CM France</h3>
	
	<img src="geoffrey.png"/>
	
	<p> Yes Kondogbia has made it into the last 10! He just oozes talent. He's a great defensive player who isn't shy in attacking! He's a top talent who tackles the you know what out of attackers and backs it up with his size. He isn't pacey, however he's gonna be a world class talent.
	</p>
	
	<h2>9.Keita Balde Diao</h2>
	
	<h3>Lazio RW/LW/ST Spain</h3>
	
	<img src="keita.png"/>
	
	<p>Keita is a new boy. I have never jeard of him until everyone and their mother went nuts over him. I after testing him can see why this kid has hype. He is just amazing. Fast, A threat towards goal and an excellent free-kick taker, Balde Diao goes down as my number 9 in the youngsters list.
	</p>
	
	<h2>8.Fares Bahlouli</h2>
	
	<h3>Lyon CAM/RW/ST France</h3>
	
	<img src="bahlouli.png"/>
	
	<p>Fares Bahlouli. He is a star. I signed him in my Atletico Madrid career mode for back up for my back up. I knew he wouldn't play every game. He even got injured for 8 weeks! After his return, I was shocked. Bahlouli came back and scored in an important game against the almighty Real Madrid and assisted the winner!! Since that he's played in the Champions League and grew on me! He has the Suarez edge to him where he can do anything on the pitch and I would highly recommend signing him!
	</p>
	
	<h2>7.Mateo Perin</h2>
	
	<h3>Genoa GK Italy</h3>
	
	<img src="perin.png"/>
	
	<p>My favourite keeper is next in Perin! He is an incredible stopper with a great save. He likes the ball in the air which is a good sign if your a keeper. HE goes down as my favourite keeper and 7th favourite starlet.
	</p>
	
	<h2>6. Jose Maria Gimenez</h2>
	
	<h3>Atletico Madrid CB Uruguay</h3>
	
	<img src="jmg.png"/>
	
	<p>Has anyone ever signed a player for so many clubs it's like without him your lost? That's exactly how I feel about Jose Maria. He is cheap and full of potential! Atletico are very lucky to have him!! I signed him for 3 teams and every time he has shined. If you need a centre back young or old sign Gimenez a strong, young, intellegant centre back!
	</p>
	
	<h2>5.Emre Can</h2>
	
	<h3>Liverpool CB/CDM/CM/Anywhere on the wings Germany</h3>
	
	<img src="can.png"/>
	
	<p>A Liverpool player made the top 5!! Emre Can is the most versatile player I have ever seen! He can player except in goals. He could even be a decent striker. He's the most all rounded player I have come across in fifa to this date. Pogba isn't even as all rounded if I'm honest. It shows I love Emre Can as he can do everything you want.
	</p>
	
	<h2>4.Fabian Schar</h2>
	
	<h3>FC Basel CB Switzerland</h3>
	
	<img src="schar.png"/>
	
	<p>Yes! A Swiss player is in the top 4 of youngsters!! Schar has been talked about for years dubbed as a future centre back to fear. He's the oldest player in my list, however he's still an incredible talent. He is my favourite centre back as he has an incredible tackle, he can head the ball and is tall. I signed him for a free in my Liverpool career and since then the SAS at my defence was born, Sakho, Skrtel and Schar. If there was ever a young player you need as a captain he's your man. I can't say anything wrong about him.
	</p>
	
	<h2>3.Paulo Dybala</h2>
	
	<h3>Palermo ST/CAM/RW Argentina</h3>
	
	<img src="dybala.png"/>
	
	<p>Number 3 is without a doubt my special gem. Paulo is a beast. He is quick and deadly towards goal. I can safely say he can score more goals then most players I have played with. He's incredible!! He single handedly gave me the Serie A for AC Milan. Over 20 goals a season is nothing for this wonder kid. He hasn't done anything wrong. The only bad thing of him is he isn't as strong as most people. That said who needs strength when you get passed defenders like they're dust! He along with a very special someone is the new Messi & Aguero.
	</p>
	
	<h2>2.Luciano Vietto</h2>
	
	<h3>Villarreal ST Argentina</h3>
	
	<img src="vietto.png"/>
	
	<p>Remember when I said Dybala has a new special partner? Vietto is exactly who I'm talking about. I'm a cheapskate in fifa and sign him for 18m was a hard decision but it was the greatest decision I ever made in that career mode. He didn't start off guns blazing which made me worry. The next season he destroyed the BPL with Liverpool. I was shocked. In two months, he was top scorer by 3 goals!! That was only the start, since then he has brought fear back into defenders. Vietto is a poacher however, a skillful one at that. I considered signing Dyabala but I knew he wouldn't be as good as Vietto, the best striker I have ever played with behind Sturridge.
	</p>
	
	<h2>1.Mateo Kovacic</h2>
	
	<h3>Inter Milan CM/CAM/CDM Croatia</h3>
	
	<p>This is the greatest player of fifa 15. I love Kovacic. He reminds me of a Steven Gerrard. He's a bit of everything but what makes him special is that as a midfield he'll go up and score a hattrick and that same match he'll make a crucial tackle to win the match. He exploded in assists too, at one point he had 15 assists in about 10 games! If you have the money in fifa buy him because he will be the best bargain you'll ever have!!
