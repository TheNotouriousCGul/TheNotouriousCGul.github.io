	<h2>Other News</h2>
	
	<h3>Mario Balotelli dropped against Stoke</h3>
	
	<p>"Mario is a doubt. Apart from that most are fit," Rodgers said in his pre-match press conference.</p>
	
	<h3>Who will be the manager next season?</h3>
	
	<img src="managerodds.PNG"/>
	
	<p>I believe BR will be sacked in the coming weeks. He just hasn't done enough for the club. It looks like Jurgen Klopp is the odds on favourite for the job. Liverpool fans already are calling themselves 'Kloppites'. FSG however, look like they prefer De Boer. Obviously both have great connections with their fellow country players. Let's not count out Rafa coming back. He os an intrest for many seasons now. It'll be an interesting few weeks for Liverpool FC.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Why Liverpool messed up Mignolet's clean-sheet record.</h3>
	
	<p>Mignolet deserved to win the golden glove. He looked certain to get it. The only problem is BR was so stressed he hasn't done anything good with the defence. It's like playing any sport, practice and training makes perfect. Clearly, a lack of defensive training has occured.
